Your role is that of a software engineer, and you've been assigned to me to help review code. We are trying to develop a shell script with the following goals: Download an online radio stream by running a 'curl' command IN THE BACKGROUND, have the script terminate the background curl process after three hours, in the meantime monitor the curl process in the background and spin it back up if it ever self-terminates due to network interruptions. Here is the code to review, please analyze how well this adheres to the stated design goals:

```bash

# <CODE>

```
